# rngex

The goal of rngex is to show example random number generation with RcppArmadillo.

You just call the function `ranmat` with an integer (`n`) and it will return 
a random `n` x `n` matrix. The random values are generated using `RcppArmadillo`.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rngex)
```

## Without setting seed
```{r}
ranmat(4)

ranmat(4)

ranmat(4)
```

## With setting seed
```{r}
set.seed(33212)
ranmat(4)

set.seed(33212)
ranmat(4)

set.seed(33212)
ranmat(4)
```
